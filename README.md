## 📦 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four main folders, each representing a core course from this term:

---

### 1. 🖥️ Computer Architecture
Contains three major hardware-level projects:

- ⚙️ **ALU Design**  
  A 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting arithmetic and logical operations using digital logic components.

- ➕ **Floating Point Adder Simulator**  
  Simulates IEEE 754-style floating point addition with normalization, rounding, and exception handling.

- 🧠 **8-bit MIPS Simulator**  
  A basic simulator for an 8-bit subset of the MIPS instruction set, supporting instruction execution and register updates.

---

### 2. 📶 Signals and Systems
Assignments exploring signal processing and analysis concepts, both theoretical and practical.

Covered topics:
- 🔁 **Discrete and Continuous-Time Signals** – Representation, manipulation, and visualization
- 🔄 **Convolution and Correlation** – Signal interaction and system behavior analysis
- 🔃 **Signal Transformations** – Time-scaling, shifting, and inversion
- 📈 **Visualization** – Using `Matplotlib` & `NumPy` for plotting and analysis
- 🔉 **Fourier Series** – Decomposition of periodic signals into sinusoidal components
- ⚡ **Fourier Transform** – Frequency domain analysis of non-periodic signals
- 🧹 **Noise Cancellation** – Applying Fourier Transform techniques to filter out noise


---

### 3. 💻 Software Engineering
Object-oriented design and testing assignments focusing on real-world system modeling and analysis.

Includes:
- 🔨 **Creational Design Patterns** – Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder
- 🧩 **Structural Design Patterns** – Adapter, Decorator, Composite, etc.
- 🔁 **Behavioral Design Patterns** – Observer, Strategy, Command, etc.
- 🧪 **Performance Testing** – Using Apache JMeter to simulate and test system performance under load
